# 🌱 Plant Pulse: Your Smart Farming Assistant

**Plant Pulse** is a smart web application built to support farmers by providing intelligent crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and plant disease diagnosis through the power of machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **🌾 Crop Recommendation**  
  Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, rainfall, and real-time temperature & humidity using OpenWeatherMap API.

- **🧪 Fertilizer Recommendation**  
  Recommends the best fertilizer based on soil nutrient imbalance for a selected crop, improving crop yield and soil health.

- **🦠 Disease Detection**  
  Uses a deep learning model to detect plant diseases from uploaded leaf images and suggests remedies for early intervention.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Get Your OpenWeatherMap API Key**
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get a free API key.
   - Open `config.py` and replace:
     ```python
     API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```

5. **Run the Flask App**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open the Web App**
   - Go to your browser and open:  
     `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. 🌾 Crop Recommendation
- Input: N, P, K, pH, rainfall, and city name.
- Weather data (temperature, humidity) is fetched from OpenWeatherMap.
- Features are passed to a Random Forest model (`RandomForest.pkl`) to predict the optimal crop.

### 2. 🧪 Fertilizer Recommendation
- Input: N, P, K values and selected crop.
- The system compares current values to ideal levels from `fertilizer.csv` and suggests adjustments.

### 3. 🦠 Disease Detection
- Input: Leaf image upload.
- Image is processed and classified using a deep learning ResNet9 model (`plant_disease_model.pth`).
- Information about the disease and remedies is shown using `disease.py`.
